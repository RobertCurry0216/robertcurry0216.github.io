      <p>
        As a team member of the advance team at TTW I would split my time
        drafting and creating in-house apps and tools, using C#, to improve the
        workflows of both the drafties and the engineers. Some major projects I
        have worked are the PT (post-tensioning) Import Tool, which will import
        and model the post-tensing in 3D, and the Column reinforcement tool, to
        model column reinforcement in 3D.
